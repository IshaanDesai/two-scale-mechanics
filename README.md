# composite-multiscale

Two-scale coupled simulation of a composite structure using the preCICE coupling library. One meso-scale simulation is coupled to many micro-scale simulations. Both the scales are solved using a range of solvers.

## Setup

The meso-scale model is a 3D beam structure which is being axially loaded. The micro-scale model is a 3D single fibre structure.

## Solvers

### Meso scale

- Dummy solver written in Python (only for testing)
- [ABAQUS](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/)

### Micro scale

- [ABAQUS](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/)
- [FANS](https://github.tik.uni-stuttgart.de/DAE/FANS)

## Dependencies

Apart from the dependencies of the solvers, the case setup itself relies on the following software:

- preCICE: See the scripts to [build_precice with MPI](build_scripts/build_precice_v3_with_Intel_MPI.sh) and [wihtout MPI](build_scripts/build_precice_v3_without_MPI.sh).
- Micro Manager: See the script to [build the Micro Manager](build_scripts/build_micro_manager.sh).

## Running the simulation

Files relevant to solvers on the meso scale are located in the folders with names `meso_*`, and similar solvers for micro scale are located in folders with names `micro_*`. Each folder has a run script, to be run directly to start the solver.

## Running simulations on a cluster

The ABAQUS-ABAQUS case was originally designed to be run on the [Great Lakes HPC cluster](https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/) at the University of Michigan. All job scripts are intended to work on any cluster with a SLURM system. Be aware that minor modifications may be necessary to the job scripts to be made usable on a cluster.
